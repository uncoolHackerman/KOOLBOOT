if the kernel returns a negative value down to -31, KOOLBOOT will interpret the return value as an error that it will print to the screen
below are the strings that will be printed for each error code.

NOTE: if KOOLBOOT post-kernel prints ("Reserved"), the error code is not used in the current version of KOOLBOOT

(0) 0x00000000: "Success"
This will cause KOOLBOOT not to start up the post-kernel environment and instead just halt the CPU.
Causes:
- The kernel exits back to KOOLBOOT without an error being raised

(-1) 0xFFFFFFFF: "System Initialisation Failure"
This error is raised when a vital component, which is required by the kernel to continue functional operation, can't be initialised.
Causes:
- Hardware needed by the kernel is not functioning or not installed
- A driver or other software in the kernel didn't start up correctly
